# pdfBot
A chatbot for asking questions to your pdf files/books.

The main code is present in LangchainRAG -> PyMuPDFRAG.ipynb
The code uses an api key from together.ai which you can find in in their website for free initially. (They give you $25 free credits.) 
Please put your own pdfs in DocumentStore. Change the prompt of the code according to your use case. You can also change the model to be used according to your preferences.

API integrations coming in another repo.

If you want to use unstructured as your document parser, the second ipynb program is there, althoguh the requirements to run that program are very high. If you want further information on that, I will upload and refine that jupyter file later.
